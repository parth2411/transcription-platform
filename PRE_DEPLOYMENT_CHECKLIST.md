# Pre-Deployment Checklist

**CRITICAL**: Complete ALL items before deploying to production

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (DO FIRST!)

### 1. Rotate Exposed API Keys üî¥ CRITICAL
Your API keys were exposed in git history. You MUST rotate them immediately:

- [ ] **Groq API Key**
  - Go to: https://console.groq.com/keys
  - Revoke the exposed key (starts with `gsk_0gCBVG...`)
  - Generate new key
  - Update `.env` file

- [ ] **Qdrant API Key**
  - Go to: https://cloud.qdrant.io (your cluster settings)
  - Revoke exposed key
  - Generate new key
  - Update `.env` file

- [ ] **Secret Key**
  - Generate new strong secret key:
    ```bash
    openssl rand -hex 32
    ```
  - Update `.env` file

---

## üîê Security Setup

- [ ] Verify `.env` file is NOT in git
  ```bash
  git status  # Should NOT show .env
  ```

- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files
  ```bash
  cat .gitignore  # Should include .env, *.backup, etc.
  ```

- [ ] Review and fill out `.env` file with correct values
  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  nano .env  # Edit with your values
  ```

- [ ] Set strong `SECRET_KEY` (at least 32 characters)

- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for production domain

---

## üì¶ Environment Configuration

- [ ] Database URL is correct
  ```env
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
  ```
